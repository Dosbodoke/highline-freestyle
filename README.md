## Development

We don't always know what we really do, but we try to keep some order, through issues ...

Checkout the [good first issue tag](https://github.com/bastislack/highline-freestyle/labels/good%20first%20issue), if you don't know where to start.


### Requirements:

- Node (v20.6.1)
- npm (v9.8.1)


### Setup

0. (Optional) If you are using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and switch between Node versions regularly use the correct one by running

   `nvm use`

1. Install node modules

   Open a terminal and in the root folder (highline-freestyle) run `npm install`

2. Start the development server

   run `npm run dev`
   
   (or `npm run host` if you want to expose the website to the local network)

Sometimes after updating you have to delete your indexDB in your browser, through the development tools (__Storage__ in Firefox, __Application__ in Chrome).


### Project structure

To work on the rewrite, simply work off of the rewrite branch and create a pull request back onto it with your fix or feature.

For all other questions either consult the [wiki](https://github.com/bastislack/highline-freestyle/wiki) or open an issue.
